# Privacy Policy for War Chest Clock

**Effective Date:** January 4, 2026

At **War Chest Clock**, we believe that your data belongs to you. Our philosophy is simple: we don’t want your data, we don’t ask for it, and we don’t collect it.

---

## 1. No Data Collection
War Chest Clock does not collect, store, or transmit any **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
* Location data (GPS).
* Device identifiers (IMEI or IP addresses).
* Contacts or calendar information.

## 2. No Usage Tracking
We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking software. We do not monitor how often you use the app, which features you interact with, or how long your sessions last.

## 3. Local Storage Only
Any settings, preferences, or timers created within the app are stored **locally on your device**. This data is never uploaded to a cloud server or shared with any third party. If you delete the app, this local data is typically removed by your operating system.

## 4. Third-Party Services
War Chest Clock does not contain:
* **Advertisements:** You won’t be tracked by ad networks.
* **Social Media Integration:** We do not link to social platforms.
* **In-App Purchases:** We do not collect payment information.

## 5. Permissions
The app may request basic system permissions required for core functionality (such as **Notifications** to alert you when a timer ends). These permissions are used solely for their intended purpose and do not involve data harvesting.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Because we do not collect any data, War Chest Clock is inherently compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly or unknowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. However, our "Zero Data" stance remains the core of our service. Any changes will be reflected by a updated "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
